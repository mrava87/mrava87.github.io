										<h2>Why bother?</h2>
										<p>
										A handful of research groups around the world care about scientific software development as much as we do. The trigger of such an interest 
										can be traced back to my previous job (working as a researcher in industry): I noticed that a lot of code was written over and over again to 
										fullfill short term research objectives, which always took precedence over long term goals. Having a solid, shared code basis can instead 
										empower all the members of a team and allow them to focus on new, exciting research questions whilst also contributing to improve the 
										quality and robustness of their shared underlying software.
										</p>

										<p>
										PyLops, our flagship software package [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019301086" style="color: #1a35bc">Ravasi and Vasconcelos [2020]</a>], 
										is a Python based framework for large-scale, matrix-free inverse problems. Built in a 
										modular fashion, it enables both beginners and advanced users to take advantage of its functionalities: the former can use it for educational 
										purposes or to build research prototype codes, the latter can leverage its dual cpu/gpu backend to develop high-performance technologies 
										such as the one that powers the software user for our Gordon Bell Prize 2023 contribution that was shortlisted as one of the 6 finalists.
										The history of PyLops provides a clear example of what a general-purpose, flexible, and scalable software package can provide in the long 
										run to both its development team and the scientific community at large. Currently, more than 80 research papers have acknowledged the use of 
										PyLops. Apart from those associated with one or more of our core developers (roughly 40%), notable examples can be found in 
										<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019301086" style="color: #1a35bc">Nightingale et al. [2021]</a>
										that exploited PyLopsâ€™ scalability to invert large astronomical datasets, 
										<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.20.064014" style="color: #1a35bc">Muller et al. [2023]</a> that 
										leveraged PyLops in their implementation of acoustic cloning, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711023002200" style="color: #1a35bc">Renders et al. [2023]</a>
										 that developed an image warping toolbox on top of PyLops. 
										We believe this to represent just a small fraction of the number of world-wide users of PyLops, and we are aware of the fact that our users are both in academia and industry.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										Over the year, additional auxiliary software packages have been built around PyLops, creating what we call nowadays the PyLops ecosystem. A notable example of this is PyProximal
										[<a href="https://github.com/openjournals/joss-papers/blob/joss.06185/joss.06185/10.21105.joss.06185.pdf" style="color: #1a35bc">Ravasi et al. [2024]</a>],
										a Python library for convex optimization. Created originally upon suggestion of one of PyLops' users, PyProximal has grown exponentially in the last few years with contributors
										coming from all over the world with different scientific background and expertise. Another recent development, which started as part of the 2023 Google Summer of Code, is
										<a href="https://gist.github.com/rohanbabbar04/8d3b957fd359c4c14d1d3882b38967f9" style="color: #1a35bc">PyLops-MPI</a>: this software package aims to extend the capabilities some of PyLops' main operators towards distribute computing via MPI (using the MPI4py library), enabling users to
										scale their PyLops codes beyond a standard single node configuration.
